# GPflow Documentation

This package contains the documentation for GPflow, to be built by readthedocs.
The `doc/` directory is automatically updated by CircleCI and hence should not be edited directly.
The only editable files in this repository are the .circleci/config.yml and .readthedocs.yml configuration files.
Please see [doc/README.md in the main GPflow repository](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop/doc/README.md) for more information.

## Issues with the docs?

This repository is only used for hosting auto-generated docs - if you find any issue with the GPflow documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/new?template=doc-issue.md) (or contribute your suggestion/fix/improvement directly through [opening a pull request](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/compare)) on the main [GPflow repository](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/). Thanks!
